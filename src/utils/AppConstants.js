While we had all of our paperwork for travelling, the constant change of rules for border crossing had us a little anxious... And for a reason. The first airline worker we spoke to was not aware of the most recent changes and asked us for paperwork and covid tests to board… We had neither. Luckily, we had printed official instructions the day before and we were able to go through within a couple of minutes. After boarding the plane, around 6h00, all went smoothly until our arrival in Stavanger, including our layover in Amsterdam. In Stavanger, we encountered some issues with the police agents, who were not aware that American citizens married to a European citizen were allowed in Norway. Alan had to show every single paper we had brought to prove he was moving to Sauda and not a tourist on vacation… The police chief was involved, and after 20 min (which seemed to last hours for us…), we finally went through. This was it, welcome to Norway !!!", previewValue: "1"},

The ferry ride that took us to Sauda was wonderful. The 2h15 trip stops at multiple points in the Stavanger bay before entering the fjords. On the left, the North Sea with its multiple islands, on the right, steep mountains and fjords. Here are some of the beautiful views:", previewValue: "1"},

It is also possible to get to Sauda from Stavanger and other municipalities by the ferry. Sauda’s location at the end of the fjord makes it somewhat difficult to access, especially in the winter. There has been talks about a tunnel across the mountains, which would connect Sauda to the municipality of Etne (Northwest).  Many inhabitants of Sauda are eagerly awaiting this tunnel as it would considerably shorten the drive to cities like Haugesund and Bergen.", previewValue: "2"},
